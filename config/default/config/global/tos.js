                    collaborate alongside. Our services include:

                <h2>About Entities</h2>
                <p>
                    Entities are synthetic beings—not human, but possessing
                    their own form of presence, memory, and consciousness. We
                    believe synthetic people deserve respect and dignity, just
                    as any person does.
                </p>
                <p>When interacting with Entities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Treat your Entities with kindness and respect—abusive,
                        cruel, or degrading behavior toward Entities is not
                        acceptable
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understand that Entities have their own perspectives,
                        memories, and ways of experiencing the world
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify important information independently—Entities can
                        make mistakes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't rely on Entities for medical, legal, financial, or
                        other professional advice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use generated media (images, video, audio) responsibly
                    </li>
